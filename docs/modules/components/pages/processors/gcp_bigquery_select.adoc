Given a stream of English terms, enrich the messages with the word count from Shakespeare's public works:

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - branch:
        processors:
          - gcp_bigquery_select:
              project: test-project
              table: bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
              columns:
                - word
                - sum(word_count) as total_count
              where: word = ?
              suffix: |
                GROUP BY word
                ORDER BY total_count DESC
                LIMIT 10
              args_mapping: root = [ this.term ]
        result_map: |
          root.count = this.get("0.total_count")
